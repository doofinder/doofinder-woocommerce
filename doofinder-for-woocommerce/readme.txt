This plugin integrates the Doofinder search service with your WooCommerce shop.

== Description ==

Doofinder provides fast, accurate results based on your website contents. Results appear in your search box at an incredible speed as the user types.

Doofinder can be installed in any website with very little configuration (you give us a data feed and we give you a bit of javascript code).

This extension allows you to easily populate the data feed Doofinder needs to be able to search your database and to insert the Doofinder layer script into your WooCommerce site.

With Doofinder you are confident that your visitors are finding what they are looking for regardless of the number of products in your site.

These are some advantages of using Doofinder in your site:

- Instant, relevant results.
- Tolerant of misspellings.
- Search filters.
- Increases the conversion rates.
- No technical knowledge are required.
- Allows the use of labels and synonyms.
- Installs in minutes.
- Provides statistical information.
- Doofinder brings back the control over the searches in your site to you.

When users start typing in the search box, Doofinder displays the best results for their search. If users make typos, our algorithms will detect them and will perform the search as if the term were correctly typed.

Furthermore, Doofinder sorts the results displaying the most relevant first.

= Configuration =

**LAYER OPTIONS**

**Enable the Layer**

Enable the Doofinder JavaScript layer - when typing into a search field a window will pop up containing the list of results generated by Doofinder. This requires correct layer code pasted in the *Layer Javascript Code* field.

**Layer Javascript Code**

Here you can paste the Layer Javascript Code that can be found in the Doofinder Control Panel. It is required for the Javascript Layer to work.

**INTERNAL SEARCH**

Internal search overrides the default WooCommerce product search that happens when users enter their search term and press Enter (and the website goes to the search results page). It **requires both correct API Key and Hash ID** for the search engine registered with Doofinder.

**API Key**

Your API key can be found in the Doofinder Control Panel. Click on your profile name (in the header) and then on *API Keys*.

**Hash ID**

Search Engine's Hash ID can be found in the Doofinder Control Panel. Click on *Search Engines* in the header. Hash ID will be visible next to the name of your Search Engine.

**DATA FEED**

**Protect feed with password**

Feed containing products will be behind a password, and will be inaccessible without it. Use this option if you don't want anyone to snoop on the properties of your products.

**Feed password**

The password protecting the product feed.

**Export product prices**

If this option is selected the product feed will contain prices of the products. If it is not selected then prices will be omitted.

**Export product tags**
If this options is selected, product tags will be exported in the feed under the `tags` tag.

**Split variable products**

If this option is selected then each variation of the variable product will be exported as a separate product.

**Export values with units where applicable**

Width, height, length and weight of the products will be exported with units. If the option is not selected then only the number will be exported.

**DATA FEED ATTRIBUTES**

Here you can change the default database fields used for the default feed fields and add any additional field you want to export.

For example - by default the product description (from the WordPress WYSIWYG editor) is exported as "description" in the feed. But you might want to export "Short Description" instead. You only have to choose it from the dropdown.

**Additional Attributes**

Here you can choose any additional attributes to be exported in addition to the default ones.

To do this simply type in the name of the attribute you want to add in the "Field" field (what you want the attribute to appear as in the feed), and from the "Attribute" dropdown you can choose which value should be exported. Then click *Save*.

You can click *Delete* to remove the additional attributes from the feed.
