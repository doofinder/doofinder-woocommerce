This plugin integrates the Doofinder search service with your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Doofinder provides fast, accurate results based on your website contents. Results appear in your search box at an incredible speed as the user types.

Doofinder can be installed in any website with very little configuration.

This extension allows you to easily populate the data Doofinder needs to be able to search your database and to insert the Doofinder layer script into your WordPress site.

With Doofinder you are confident that your visitors are finding what they are looking for.

These are some advantages of using Doofinder in your site:

- Instant, relevant results.
- Tolerant of misspellings.
- Search filters.
- Increases the conversion rates.
- No technical knowledge are required.
- Allows the use of labels and synonyms.
- Installs in minutes.
- Provides statistical information.
- Doofinder brings back the control over the searches in your site to you.

When users start typing in the search box, Doofinder displays the best results for their search. If users make typos, our algorithms will detect them and will perform the search as if the term were correctly typed.

Furthermore, Doofinder sorts the results displaying the most relevant first.

== Requirements==

__Important:__ To use this plugin you need to have an account at Doofinder. If you don't have one you can signup [here](http://www.doofinder.com/signup) to get your 30 day free trial period.

The minimum technical requirements are basically the same as the WordPress ones. Take a look at their [server requirements](https://docs.WordPress.com/document/server-requirements/) for more info.

== Installation ==

__Important__: If you're upgrading to v0.4.x or greater from v0.3.x or lower, deactivate the plugin and activate again to migrate settings.

Doofinder installation and activation is made [as in any other plugin](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins).

These are two ways you can install the plugin:

1. In the WordPress admin panel go to Plugins / Add New. Click "Upload Plugin". Choose the *.zip file containing the plugin, and click "Install Now". or...
2. Unpack the contents of the *.zip file containing the plugin to the plugins folder. In the typical WordPress installation that will be "/wp-contents/plugins" folder.

== Configuration ==

Once activated, you will see a new entry in the main menu called _Doofinder_ with two sub-menus:

- **Doofinder:** To access the main settings page of the module.

**NOTICE:** Doofinder for WordPress has built-in support for [WPML](https://wpml.org/es/). In case you are using it, ensure you've switched _context_ to one of the defined languages. In _All Languages_ context you won't be able to configure anything. You will have to configure as many search engines as languages you have in your site.

Doofinder Settings
==================

General Settings
--------------

- **API Key:** This is the secret token you use to index contents (in ML environments you can share the same key). Your API key can be found in the Doofinder Control Panel. Click on your profile name (in the header) and then on *API Keys*. Make sure you're using a _Management_ API key and not a _Search_ API key.
- **Search Engine HashID:** Id of the search engine that will index your contents. Can be found in the Doofinder Control Panel. Click on *Search Engines* in the header. Hash ID will be visible next to the name of your Search Engine. Remember to use different search engines for different languages if you're in a ML environment.
- **Update on Save:** The period of time that must elapse before the posts / products are updated after making a change.
- **JS Layer Script:** Here you can modify the Layer Javascript Code. It is required for the Javascript Layer to work.
