== Requirements ==

**Important**: To use this plugin you need to have an account with Doofinder. If you don't have an account, you can sign up [here](http://www.doofinder.com/signup?utm_campaign=Content&utm_source=WooCommerce%20Profile&utm_content=Doofinder%20Sign%20Up) to start your 30-day free trial period.

The minimum technical requirements are the same as the WordPress ones.

== Configuration ==

**One-Click Indexing of All WordPress Content**

Check out our support page and follow the steps for installation: [go to the support page!](https://support.doofinder.com/plugins/woocommerce/installation-guide/pre-requisites-woocommerce.html)

**NOTICE**:

Doofinder for WordPress comes with built-in support for [WPML](https://wpml.org/). If you're using it, make sure you've switched to one of the defined languages. If you stay in the "All Languages" context, you won't be able to set up anything. You'll need to set up a search engine for each language on your site.

== General Settings ==

You will see that the installation is very simple, but to make it easier you should familiarize yourself with some basic concepts.

-   **API Key**: This is the secret code you use to organize content (in machine learning setups, you can share the same code). You can find your API key in the Doofinder Control Panel. Click on your profile name (at the top) and then on API Keys. Make sure you're using a Management API key, not a Search API key.
-   **Search Engine HashID**: This is the ID of the search engine that will organize your content. You can find it in the Doofinder Control Panel. Click on Search Engines in the top menu. The Hash ID will be shown next to the name of your Search Engine. Remember to use different search engines for different languages if you're in a machine-learning environment.
-   **Update on Save**: This is the time it takes for posts/products to be refreshed after you make a change.
-   **JS Layer Script**: Here, you can adjust the Layer JavaScript Code. The JavaScript Layer needs it to work properly.
